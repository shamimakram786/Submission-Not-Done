# Submission-Not-Done
Due to extremely limited time, I was unable to submit a functional project. I came to know about this assignment today evening and could not prepare a demo.


I sincerely apologize for not being able to submit a full project. I came to know about this assignment only recently, and due to extremely limited time, I could not prepare a functional demo. I understood that the assignment requires creating a user-friendly MGNREGA dashboard where citizens can view their districtâ€™s current and past performance in an easy-to-understand manner, including comparisons and visualizations. I regret any inconvenience this may cause and hope to demonstrate my capabilities in future assignments. Thank you for your understanding and consideration.
